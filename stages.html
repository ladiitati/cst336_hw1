            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>The first stage is planning. This stage is used for gathering information. During this stage consider asking questions like:
            How will the software be used?
            What data will be used as input?
            What data will be outputted?
            Who will use the software?
            </p>

                <h3>Analysis</h3>
                <p> The second stage is analysis. After collecting your data it is time to analyze your findings to determine if your idea is feasible and valid. During this stage this is were requirement specification are documented</p>

                <h3>Development & Testing</h3>
                <p>The fourth stage is development and test, which is one of the longest stages in this process. This is where all the magic and coding happens. Developers divy up the work based on the module/unit created in the designing stage.</p>

                <h3>Implementation</h3>
    
                <p>The fifth stage is implementation or known as the deployment stage. This stage is followed after a successful testing of the software. Developers will deploy their code to customers who are beta testers who will report back to the development of all bugs and enhancements. Once all the changes are complete and all issues have been resolved then comes the final deployment.</p>

                <h3>Maintenance</h3>
                <p>The final stage is maintenance. This stage handles any problems that are experienced by the end users while using the software.</p>
